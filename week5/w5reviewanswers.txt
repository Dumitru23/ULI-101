Write a single command to do all of the following:

Take columns 2 and 4 from people.csv
Sort in reverse alphabetical order
Take top 10 lines
Take bottom 3 lines
Get only lines with "joe" in them
Store output in "out.txt"
Send any error messages to the "black hole"

cut -f2,4 -d, people.csv | sort -r | head | tail -3 | grep joe > out.txt 2> /dev/null



Write a single command to do all of the following:

Sort people.csv by column 2 in alphabetical order
Take columns 1 and 3-5 from the output of the previous command
Take top 10 lines
Save the output to this point in a file named temp (remember 'tee')
Get only lines that do not have "joe" in them, including line numbers, case insensitive
Append standard output to "out.txt"
Redirect any error messages to the same place as where standard output goes (remember the special syntax)

sort -k2 -t, people.csv | cut -f1,3-5 -d, | head | tee temp | grep -v -i -n joe >> out.txt 2>&1
