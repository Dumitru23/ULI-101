Week 3 review
Instructions:
The following questions are similar to those you may find on the midterm and final.
It is intended that you complete the questions without first creating the tree and then
 experimenting with it, since you will not have such opportunity during the tests.
Open this exercise in VI and type your answers in the space provided.
Do not check your answers until you have attempted all questions.
Use the following tree for each question.
Each question is independent of the others.
Regular files have names beginning with f, e.g. f1 etc. All other items are directories
.
Your username is joe for this exercise.
The tree is repeated here to make it easier to check your answers.

/
└── home
	└── joe
		├── blue
		│   └── green
		│       └── red
		│           └── f1
		└── white
		    ├── black
		    │   ├── green
		    │   └── red
		    │       └── f2
		    └── pink

1. Write the command to copy f1 to black/green

relative (pwd = blue/green)
cp red/f1 ../../white/black/green

absolute
cp /home/joe/blue/green/red/f1 /home/joe/white/black/green

relative-to-home
cp ~/blue/green/red/f1 ~/white/black/green
/
└── home
	└── joe
		├── blue
		│   └── green
		│       └── red
		│           └── f1
		└── white
		    ├── black
		    │   ├── green
		    │   └── red
		    │       └── f2
		    └── pink

2. Write the command to copy f2 to pink

relative (pwd = pink)
cp ../black/red/f2 .

absolute
cp /home/joe/white/black/red/f2 /home/joe/white/pink

relative-to-home
cp ~/white/black/red/f2 ~/white/pink

/
└── home
	└── joe
		├── blue
		│   └── green
		│       └── red
		│           └── f1
		└── white
		    ├── black
		    │   ├── green
		    │   └── red
		    │       └── f2
		    └── pink

3. Write the command to copy black and all its contents to green/red

relative (pwd = blue)
cp -r ../white/black green/red

absolute
cp -r /home/joe/white/black /home/joe/blue/green/red

relative-to-home
cp -r ~/white/black ~/blue/green/red


For the purpose of the following questions, the commands for each question are all exec
uted while the current directory contains the following files:
1.f    2.f  6.f  f1       f1.txt  f4.txt  file3.txt  t.xt
1text  3.f  f    f1.text  f2      f-a     text1
Use wildcards where ever possible.

You can find the answers for yourself by experimenting with the wildcards directory, which you can copy to your own account from ~john.samuel/useful_files/wildcards

4. Write the command to list just the files that end in .f

5. Write the command to list just the files that contain 3 characters.

6. What filenames will be printed by the command
ls ?.[0-9]

7. What filenames will be printed by the command
ls [1t]*[1t]
(that is a one and a tee in the square brackets)

8. What filenames will be printed by the command
ls *e*

9. What command will print only the files in the current directory that have exactly 2 characters, and the last character is a digit?
