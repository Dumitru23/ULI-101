sed and awk practice

sed
The following questions use a file called new_inventory and you can find it in
the same directory as this exercise.
You can copy this file and use this file to verify your answers and experiment.
You must write your answers so that they would work with additional or different data, don't tailor them to just these records.
The columns are
id #, product name, number on hand, reorder level

1. Print just lines 3-6 of the file.


2. Print all the lines up to and including the first occurence of Compote and then quit.


3. Print all the lines except lines 2-4.


4. Substitute all the vowels on lines 4-6 with X and print only the affected lines.


5. Change all uppercase letters to lowercase.


6. Write the id#s of the lines printed by the following command
sed '5 q' new_inventory


7. Write the id#s of the lines printed by the following command
sed '1,6 d' new_inventory


8. Write the id#s of the lines printed by the following command
sed '/^[A-M]/ p' new_inventory


9. Write the id#s of the lines printed by the following command
sed '/[A-M]/ p' new_inventory



awk
The following questions use a file called cars2 and you can find it in
the same directory as this exercise.
You can copy this file and use this file to verify your answers and experiment.
You must write your answers so that they would work with additional or different data, don't tailor them to just these records.
The columns are
id #, make, model, year (missing the 19), kilometers (in thousands), cost

10. Write the command to format the data in the file so that it will display data from all lines in the following format (first line shown as an example)
The cost of a 1977 plym fury with 73000 kilometers is $2500.



11. Add a filter to the above formatting so that it only prints the above formatted output for the entries that have less than 50000 km.



12. Modify the above command so that it only prints the above formatted output for the entries that have less than 50000 km and cost less than 10000.



13. Write the command to print all lines of the file (unformated) whose model starts with any letter from d-k and whose year ends with an odd digit.


14. Write the id#s of the lines printed by the following command
awk '$4 > 80 || $5 < 20' cars2


15. Write exactly what will be printed by the following command
awk '$4>64 && $4<77 {print "the year is " $4 " and the mileage is " $5}' cars2
